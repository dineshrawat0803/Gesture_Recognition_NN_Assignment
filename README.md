# Gesture_Recognition_NN_Assignment (Deep Learning Course Project)
PG Diploma in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore | Upgrad

*   Dinesh Rawat - Group facilitator

## Problem Statement:
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command.

## Gesture	Corresponding Action:

1. Thumbs Up Iindicates increase in the volume
2. Thumbs Down	indicates decrease the volume
3. Left Swipe	'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
4. Right Swipe	'Jump' forward 10 seconds
5. Stop	Pause the movie
6. Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images)


## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib 
- Skimage, CV2, Imageio
- Tensorflow & Keras
